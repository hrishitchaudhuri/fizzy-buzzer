# Fizz Buzz
Why is Buzz fizzing? Why is Fizz buzzing? Like many things in the hiring process: **Guess we'll never know**.  

This determines your worth so make sure to memorize these lines of code even if that means having to forget your name (you can always get a new one, fizz buzz is forever).  

## What is this
Linking is the way to go. That's how the internet was built wasn't it?  
That or maybe I'm wayyy to lazy to explain it so here ya go : [Nice Wikipedia link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz#Programming).

## Usage
* Execute it as `./z.out [number of fizz-buzz numbers to be printed]`

## Notes
* There may be edge cases I haven't taken care of (interviewer shakes head in disappointment) so if you find any and manage to break the program please mention it in issues or make a PR adding it under **Notes** over here. (Or if you're feeling particularly nice you could also submit a fix for that bug)
