# Fizz Buzz
Why is Buzz fizzing? Why is Fizz buzzing? Like many things in the hiring process: **Guess we'll never know**.  

## What is this
The one shot method to determine your worth, candidate #42069.  
"Tell me about yourself"? More like "Stall for 30s while I do inky-pinky-ponky on this question bank".  
I'm waaay to lazy to explain it so here ya go : [Nice Wikipedia link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz#Programming).

## Usage
* Create executable using `make` or using `nasm`(64 bit format) and a linker.
* Execute it as `./z.out`. It will prompt you for the number of fizz buzz numbers to be printed.

## Notes
* There **will** be edge cases I haven't taken care of (interviewer shakes head in disappointment). If you find any and manage to break the program, feel free mention it in issues. It will be attributed to you in the fix. Or if you're feeling particularly nice you could also submit a fix for that bug
