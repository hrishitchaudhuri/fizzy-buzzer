# Fizz Buzz
Why is Buzz fizzing? Why is Fizz buzzing? Like many things in the hiring process: **Guess we'll never know**.  

## What is this
The one shot method to determine your worth, candidate #42069.  
Did you actually think "tell me about yourself" mattered? Tut tut. Go suck a dick.  
I'm waaay to lazy to explain it so here ya go : [Nice Wikipedia link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz#Programming).

## Usage
* Execute it as `./z.out [number of fizz-buzz numbers to be printed]`

## Notes
* There will be edge cases I haven't taken care of (interviewer shakes head in disappointment) so if you find any and manage to break the program feel free mention it in issues. It will be attributed to you in the fix. Or if you're feeling particularly nice you could also submit a fix for that bug
