# Hello, world!
The mother of all programs. Your one-way VIP ticket to this mess that we fondly call "tHe TeCh InDuStRy".  

Remember the first time you wrote a piece of code and had the computer execute it?  
Was it hello-world?  
If yes, you're in luck! (No? We are not going to progress your appli...)  
Let this program remind of that moment.  
So that you can regret it for the rest of your life ðŸ™‚

## Usage
* Execute as `./z.out [anything you want, because no one's going to read it. No one cares]`

## Notes
Bonus points for figuring out the encoding.  
What can you do with those? Shov- nvm.
