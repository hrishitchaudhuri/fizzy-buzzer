## Common instructions
This is 64-bit x86 assembly. You will need:
* [NASM](https://www.nasm.us/index.php), your assembler. For Linux users with apt, just do `sudo apt install nasm`. // Windows users, get WSL already!
* A linker, `ld` or `link.exe` should be available on your system.  
The makefiles are relatively small. Feel free to copy paste commands from there. In general:
* Assemble with `nasm -f elf64 prog.asm` (Change format for Windows OR just use WSL2 :upside_down_face:).
* Link it with `ld prog.o` or the Windows alternative with `link.exe`.
* Execute as `./a.exe [args]` or the Linux alternative.
